## Systems:

* Frontend: Utilizes Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript with JADE view engine and Express, to offer a user friendly frontend for login and and user interaction. The goal for the users was to have a good user experience for video upload, and also to allow them to view real time, processed video straight from their webcam. 
* Backend Server: Nginx and distributed computing networked capabilities utilizing AWS and allows for real time video processing when combined with the video processing system.
* PostgreSQL Server: First normal form due to simplicity in design. It only contained a user table and a video table for each video which has a foreign key associated with username. The video table contains information on filepath of a video file and a json with all of its information.
* Video Processing: FFMPEG, OpenCV, dlib and EyeLike, combined with delaunayâ€™s triangle algorithm breaks a video into component frames, scrapes metadata and adds 68 points with meshed lines. It also bounds the eyes and tracks the pupil locations which are then written to the database.

## Challenges

* Utilizing OpenCV and dlib for face recognition and point detection
* To draw and connect points using the Delaunay triangle algorithm
* Implementing a multi-server architecture
* Real time video processing
* Staying on schedule
* Choosing between quality and speed of processing
* Keeping large operations fast (such as FFMPEG un-stitching and restitching of frames)
* To repurpose multiple existing codebases into a different use
* Ensuring frequent meetings amongst busy schedules
* Yaw, Pitch and Roll detection
* Getting frames into and out of EyeLike
